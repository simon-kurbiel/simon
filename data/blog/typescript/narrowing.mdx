## Introduction

Welcome! This is a basic introduction into narrowing in javascript.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Introduction" />

## The typeof type guards in javascript.

These are the types that javascipt supports, although the list is not exhaustive.

- "string"
- "number"
- "boolean"
- "undefined"
- "object"
- "function"

Now syppose you have a function with one parameter. The goal is to print every thing in there. The code can look something like this.

```ts
const printAll = (strs: string | string[] | null) => {
  if (typeof strs === 'object') {
    for (const s of strs) {
      console.log(s)
    }
  } else if (typeof strs === 'string') {
    console.log(strs)
  } else {
    // do nothing
  }
}
```

Now, it might not be very obvious, but this will raise an error in typescript. This is because `null` is also an `object`. This is one of the quirks of the language. To by pass this we can do truthiness narrowing

## Truthiness narrowing

if you have experience with low level language such as [C](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>), you will be familiar with checking whether a value is 0 which is falsy, whereas any other value is truthy.
Javascript follows the same format. Any of these types will be identified as falsy (list is not exhaustive)

- ""
- undefined
- null
- 0
- NaN

## Refine code

Now that we know which types will constitute a falsy value, lets refactor the code.

```ts
const printAll = (strs: string | string[] | null) => {
  if (strs && typeof strs === 'object') {
    for (const s of strs) {
      console.log(s)
    }
  } else if (typeof strs === 'string') {
    console.log(strs)
  } else {
    // do nothing
  }
}
```

The only thing needed in this case, was to make sure that `strs` was both truthy and an `object`
