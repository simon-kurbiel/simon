## Introduction

The sequential search works on an unsorted array and runs in $O(n)$ time. But if the array is sorted, it can be done much more efficiently in $O(\log_2n)$ time though a divide and conquer algorithm known as binary-search.

## How it works

The algorithm is very simple. Given a sorted array, $array[0:n-1]$, and a serach key, the algorithm starts comparising the search key against the **middle** element of the array, $array[m]$. Then it follows these steps.

1. if $KEY = array[m]$, simply return m.
2. if $KEY > array[m]$, the recursively the right half othe array.
3. if $KEY < array[m]$, the recursively the left half othe array.

As we can see, after one operation, the size is ruded to $\frac {n}{2}$. After a second operation, the size is ruded to $\frac {n}{4}$ and so on. So in the worst case scenario, the algorithms will make $\log_2n$ comparisons. here is the code below.

### Algorithm

```py
def binary_search(array:list,left:int, right:int, key:int)->int:
    if left >= right:
        return -1
    m = int((left+right)/2)
    if key == array[m]:
        return m
    elif key > array[m]:
        return binary_search(array, left+1, right, key)
    return binary_search(array,left,m-1, key )
```

### Analysis for special case

when $n=2^k$,

we will assume that both the key comparisons as one sinle comparison. That is because that they are between the same pair of elements. Under the hood(assembly), the machine will probably do some optimization to count them as single one operation, thus we will consider them to be one. In that case

$$
\begin{align*}
f(n)=
\begin{cases}
1, & \quad n=1 \\
1+f( \frac {n}{2}) & \quad n≥2
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$

Solving this by **repeated substitutions**, we will obtain:

$$
\begin{align*}
&f(n) = 1+f(\frac{n}{2}) \\
&f(n) = 1+1+f(\frac{n}{4}) \\
&f(n) = 1+1+1+f(\frac{n}{8}) \\
&f(n) = 1+1+1+1+f(\frac{n}{16}) \\
&f(n) = 4+f(\frac{n}{2^4}) \\
&f(n) = k+f(\frac{n}{2^k}) \\
&f(n) = k+1 \\
&f(n) = \log_2n+1 \\
\end{align*}
$$

### Analysis for general n

for the general case, the size of the recursive call is at most $\lfloor \frac {n}{2} \rfloor$. So,

$$
\begin{align*}
f(n)=
\begin{cases}
1, & \quad n=1 \\
1+f( \lfloor \frac {n}{2} \rfloor) & \quad n≥2
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$

We will prove by induction that the solution is $f(n) = \lfloor \log_2n \rfloor +1$

1. base case, $n=1 \text{ from the recurrence, }f(1)=1 \text{ and the claimed solution is }f(n) = \lfloor \log_21 \rfloor+1=1 $, so the basic is correct.
2. **induction step**. Any $n$ can be expressed as follows, for some integer $k$.

   $$
   2^k \le n < 2^{k+1}
   $$

   This means that $ \lfloor \log_2n \rfloor = k$. Also,

   $$
    2^{k-1} \le \lfloor \frac {n}{2} \rfloor < 2^k
   $$

   Thus, $ \lfloor \log_2 \lfloor \frac {n}{2} \rfloor \rfloor = k-1$. To prove the claimed solution for any $n \ge 2$, suppose the solution is correct for all smaller values. That is,

   $$
    f(m) =  \lfloor \log m \rfloor +1, \quad \forall m < n
   $$

   In particular, for $m = \lfloor \frac {n}{2} \rfloor $,

   $$
    f(\lfloor \frac {n}{2} \rfloor) = \lfloor \log_2 \lfloor \frac {n}{2} \rfloor \rfloor +1  = (k-1)+1 = k = \lfloor \log_2n \rfloor
   $$

   Then,

   $$
    f(n) =  f(\lfloor \frac {n}{2} \rfloor) + 1 = k+1 =  \lfloor \log_2n \rfloor + 1
   $$
