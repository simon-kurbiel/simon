## Introduction

This will be the introduction to data structures and algorithms. For the programming parts, most programs will be written in python, however, I might add C parts as well. Here is the table of contents.

## Worst-case and Average-case Analysis

### Linear Search Algorithm

let us take a simple algorithm such as the linear search. We have a key $k$, and we would like to find it's index. Here is the algoriithm

```py
def linear_search(arr, key):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == key:
            return i
    return -1

```

#### worst-case

The worst case will be mostly what we are looking for, not only because it is easier, but also because it is a good reflection of overall performance.
In this case, the worst case is abviously $n$, if the key is the last item or if it doesn't exists at all. Because each iteration of the for loop will take some constant time $C$, in this case, the worst-case time of the algorithm is

$$
T(n) \le Cn+D
$$

The constant $D$ represents the maximum amount of time for all statements that are execute only once, independent of the variable $n$

#### average case

Calculating the average case is a bit more involved, so we will skip it as worst-case is what is mostly sought after.

### Finding Max & Min of an Array

Here is a python program to find the max and min of an Array

```py
def max_min(array:list)->tuple:
    max:int =array[0]
    min:int = array[0]

    for i in range(1,len(array)):
        if array[i] > max:
            max = array[i]
        elif array[i] < min:
            min = array[i]

    return min,max
```

#### worst case

in this case, the worst case scenario is very simple to spot. The for loop will be executed at least $n-1$ times at skips the first index. However, the worst case scenario is if it is in a decending order, which means both if else blocks will be executed which makes our algorithm run $2(n-1)$ times
