## Introduction

Although solving by substitution is one great way of solving a recurrence equation/relation problem, the master theorem provides an easier alternative to solve a general class of a problem.

## General Form

The following is a general form of recurrences which commonly arise in divide-and-conquer algorithms. ($a,b,c,d$ and $\beta$ are constants determined by the specific algorithm, and $n= b^k$ for some integer $k$.)

$$
T(n)
\begin{cases}
a \cdot T(\frac {n}{b}) + c \cdot n^ \beta, & \quad n > 1 \\
d, & \quad n=1
\end{cases}
$$

1. The term $T(\frac {n}{b})$ represents the time for solving each subproblem.
2. And the term $cn^ \beta$ represents the additional work for "combining" the solutions of the subproblems to find the overall solution.

### Solutions.

Let $h = \log_ba$. The solution has the following general forms and bounds. (A and B are some constants for each case.)

$$
\boxed{T(n) =
\begin{cases}
An^h+Bn^ \beta = \Theta (n^h) & \quad h > \Beta \\
An^h+Bn^ \beta = \Theta (n^ \beta) & \quad h < \Beta \\
An^h \log_2n+Bn^ \beta = \Theta (n^h \log_2n) & \quad h = \Beta
\end{cases}}


$$

## Examples

### Finding max of array

Finding the max of an array by divide and conquer for the case when $n=2^k$ is:

$$
f(n)=
\begin{cases}
0, & \quad n=1 \\
2f(\frac {n}{2})+1, & \quad n \ge 2
\end{cases}
$$

Let us apply our Masterm Theorem to find the solution form.

$$
\begin{align*}
&a=2,b=2, \beta = 0 \\
&h= \log_22 = 1
\end{align*}
$$

Since $h \ne \beta$, the solution form is

$$
\begin{align*}
&f(n) = An^h+Bn^ \beta \\
&= An+B
\end{align*}
$$

**Finding The constants A and B**
In this case, simce we know the solution form is correct, we just need to plug in values for n.

$n=1$:

$$
\begin{align*}
&f(1) = 0 \quad \text{from the recurrence} \\
&=A+B \quad \text{from the solution form}
\end{align*}
$$

$n=2$:

$$
\begin{align*}
&f(2) = 2f(1)+1 = 2 \cdot 0+1=1 \\
&=2A+B
\end{align*}
$$

So we have two equations:

$$
\begin{cases}
A+B = 0 \\
2A+B=1
\end{cases}
$$

We find the constants $A=1, B=-1$. Therefore,

$$
\boxed{f(n) = n-1}
$$
