## Introduction
A heap is a data-structure that implements a priority queue, by using a complete-binary-
tree. Each node of the tree contains one element, and they are organized by their key values, such that
$$
\text{key of every node â‰¤ keys of its left and right children}.
$$
Therefore, the root has the smallest key value. Below is an example heap with 6
nodes. The values inside the nodes are the key values.

Finally, a heap of $n$ nodes is represented efficiently by an array $A[1: n]$, where $A[i]$
represents node $i$. For example, the array representation of the above heap is as shown
below.

| i    | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A[i] | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 9   |
